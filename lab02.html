			<b>I began on October 15th. I was starting at a slight disadvantage already being a third of the way through the month and the<br>fact that i will have to clone or fork a repositoty first. The time crunch motivated me. I decided i would try to sumbit a pull<br>request every day for the rest of the month. Setting a schedule two or three days out of the work and tried not to stress the rest of<br>the time. Regardless of how ambitious your goal is, five pull requests in a month or five pull requests in a week: it's important to<br>have a plan. My first pull request was on Women Tech Speakers Organizers. I was glancing through some of the organizations on<br>github. I received a link massage to pull request fempire/women-tech-speakers-organizers. It was a simple fix but it provided<br>some needed confidence. There were indeed things out there that i could tackle!<br><br>The pull request was easy, I didn't fork or clone the repository, I opened it right on the Github page.<br><br></b>

		    <b>I didn't want all five pull requests to come from one repository (although there is nothing wrong with that). After a few pull<br>requests on other repositories, I started venturing out and exploring GitHub. I started by looking at projects i was familiar with.<br>Specifically, I browsed tools and projects that i had used a lot like C++, Python, Bootstrap and PHP among others.<br><br>Whenever possible i searched by issues tagged "Hacktoberfest" or "First Time Contributor".<br><br>It was really great and fun that made me not to stop there but made it a starting point, all thanks to the motivators.</b>
